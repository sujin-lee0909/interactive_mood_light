# About this project
### 1.Getting Started

Only download .ino file and upload in arduino. And you need country's panel and 3 arduino's touch sensors, MDF(wood panel) and acrylic panel(country_panel). I uploded .ai file(MDF_design.ai and country_panel_design.ai) so you can download these and cut MDF and acrylic according to design.

### 2. How to interact
You can interact with mood light by changing country's panel. But you have to know that I tried to use wifi module ESP8266, but it doesn't work well. So I had to get country weather's info randomlly.
